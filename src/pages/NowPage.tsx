          Corres is the main new build: a native Apple-first email app, and the studio’s next flagship
          alongside Artha. Email, considered.

          Right now I’m working on the iPhone experience: its materials and type, the design system,
          and how you move between Brief, Needs You, and Waiting. The build uses sample conversations
          while those interactions take shape. Gmail is planned for the first release.

          Artha is already available. I’m polishing it further for everyday use, smoothing out the
          usability and functionality without changing how the decisions and approvals stay in your
          hands.

          Jotfield is getting the most attention of the rest: I’m ironing out rough edges from using
          it daily. Doorsong, Tether, and Stub are live and stable, with fixes as they come up. Ranna,
          keeping my mom’s handwritten recipes for the next generation, is planned but not started yet.
