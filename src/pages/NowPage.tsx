          Corres is the main new build: a native Apple-first email app, and the studio’s next flagship
          alongside Artha. Email, considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beta is on TestFlight with early testers, nine builds in, and it&rsquo;s my own daily
          driver, now for Outlook as well as Gmail, in one inbox. It sorts what needs you and keeps a Primary inbox that learns from every correction,
          with Promotions, Social and Updates kept apart. Writing is now complete, from drafts and Send
          Later to follow-up reminders and sharing straight into an email from any app, and Apple
          Intelligence, running entirely on the iPhone, summarizes threads and drafts replies in your
          voice. Next: more testers, iCloud Mail, then the App Store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artha is already available. I’m polishing it further for everyday use, smoothing out the
          usability and functionality without changing how the decisions and approvals stay in your
          hands.

          After that, it’s Jotfield: ironing out rough edges from using it daily. Doorsong, Tether,
          and Stub are live and stable, with fixes as they come up. Ranna, keeping my mom’s handwritten
          recipes for the next generation, is planned but not started yet.
